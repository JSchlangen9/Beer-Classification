# DTSA 5509: Beer ML Project

## Project Overview

For this project, I will be analyzing the public Beer Profile Ratings Data Set from Kaggle (linked below). The goal of this project will be to create a classification model that accurately predicts the type/style of beer based on  some of its characteristics. My intial thought is to utilize a Decision Tree Classifer or an Ensemble/Random Forrest model; however; I will test additional models as needed depednding upon accuracy.


## Beer Profile Ratings Data Set

As previosly mentioned, the dataset for this project was found from Kaggle and includes a variety of attributes about various beers. In ther dataset, there are roughly 3200 beers included, and some key featurs of the beers are: Style, ABV, Alcohol, Taste, and Flavor. After cleaning, I expect to use 'Style' as the response, and there will be 19 predictors that can be tested/used in the model.
